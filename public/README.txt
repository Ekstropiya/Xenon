Welcome, and thank you for choosing Xenon Web Service. Here
at the Omnicron Corporation we strive to provide the best
products and services possible. Xenon is one of our many
services written by our brilliant programmers. Here are a
few short notes to keep in-mind when using Xenon:

| NOTES |
+-------+

    - Things will probably be slower than usual, remember,
      your requests have to travel double- maybe even
      triple the normal distance.

    - Some things don't work. But, some things do- including
      Discord.

    - We're working on fixing any incompatible websites.

    - You may have to use the QR code to login
      to Discord.

    - Any outages SHOULD be fixed with 1-2 hours.

    - This isn't some fly-by-night service. We're an incredibly
      real and legitimate company. Look us up. We're in the
      Yellow Pages.

Well, if you made it this far, I like you: you actually read the
README. Now you can get on with your day playing games, watching
Netflix, or chatting on Discord while at work or school.
